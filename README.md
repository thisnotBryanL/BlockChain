# BlockChain
An implementation of a simple Blockchain

## Goals for this project
* Understand the basic structure of blockchain technology
* Become familiar with some basic public key cryptographic techniques
* Have a simple running framework for a peer-to-peer shared ledger system based on a blockchain
* Understand the basic idea of "work" which is used to guarantee the validity of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin
* Have a collection of code utilities for working with blockchain technology, and cryptography that can be applied to many applications
* Have a rudimentary working konwledge of JSON

## Usage
* Compile the java files to classes
* Create 3 terminals
* In each terminal:  
  * Navigate to the Blockchain class directory
  *  "java BlockChain 1"
  *  "java BlockChain 2"
  *  "java BlockChain 3"
